# Local-Registration-and-login
Project 1, July 7, 2022

This is my first ever project and I chose cpp for implementing it.
It stores Username and Password locally within a file.
Thus it saves different ids into different files which is not very good.
However, I'll be updating this and will try to make it into a single file with updates as I learn more stuff
